# Voron 2.4 Raspberry Pi Camera Mount

#### This mount places a Raspberry Pi camera to the rear of the print bed, behind the X rail.  It mounts to the bed rails and can be placed on either the left or right side.

It is intended to be used with this [wide-angle pi camera](https://www.amazon.ca/Keyestudio-Camera-Fish-Eye-Wide-Angle-Raspberry/dp/B076MPL9P1).  Note the ribon cable connector is on the front side of the camera - this mount will not work with cameras with the connector on the back side.
