# Fiber Optic LED Mod

Thanks to **PF#9918** on the Voron Discord for the original idea and design/process help along the way. 
Shout-out to **Logan#2225** on the Voron Discord for the idea to use transparent filament as a fiber optic cable.

#### This mod makes Raspberry Pi LEDs visible at front of machine.  This is particularly useful to ensure the Pi is finished its shutdown sequence prior to cutting power

## Help Wanted
* If you test with transparent PETG - please let me know if it works.
* If you test with a Pi 3B+ or Pi 4B - please confirm that everything fits.  The CAD looks compatible but I don't have those boards to test.
