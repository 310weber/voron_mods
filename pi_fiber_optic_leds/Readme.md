# Fiber Optic LED Mod

### This mod makes Raspberry Pi LEDs visible at front of machine.  This is particularly useful to ensure the Pi is finished its shutdown sequence prior to cutting power

Thanks to **PF#9918** on the Voron Discord for the original idea and design/process help along the way. 

## Part List
* **Pi 3B Fiber Optic Mount Normal:** Fiber optic mount for Raspberry Pi 3B(+) - mounts fiber vertical above the LED; light couples through the end of the fiber (worked best in my experience)
* **Pi 3B Fiber Optic Mount Horizontal:** Fiber optic mount for Raspberry Pi 3B(+) - mounts fiber horizontal across the LEDs; light must couple through the side of the fiber (will not work with all optical fiber)
* **Voron v2.4 Front Skirt Fiber Optic Insert:** Fiber holder that mounts in the front skirt of Voron v2.4
