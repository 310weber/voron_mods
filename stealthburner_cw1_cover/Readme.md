# Stealthburner Clockwork1 Connector Cover

#### Based on the Clockwork1_PCB_Cover design that is included in the [Stealthburner CAD package](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner).  This version is intended to be used without a toolhead PCB as a replacement for the stock Clockwork1 connector cover.  It has extra room for the added LED connector needed for Stealthburner.
